Edge compute with p2p (peer to peer) network, base on IPFS & IPFS pubsubã€‚

### Why p2p edge compute?

- With the rise of the Internet of Things, the emergence of 5G networks will generate more data and more connections. The IDC construction of traditional cloud solutions is time-consuming and labor-intensive, and it is impossible to achieve large-area coverage, so that a large amount of data is transmitted over long distances. There will be a large delay in the process.

- P2p networks have a large number (smart hardware, sensors, personal computers, etc.). Most of them have low resource utilization. If we can use some way to integrate these resources, it can solve the geographical coverage in edge computing not enough problems, and it has a very big economic advantage.
